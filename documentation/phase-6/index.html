        <h1>Phase 6 - Dissection and Prevention of Interpersonal Conflict</h1>
        <p>Estimated time: 45-120 min</p>
        
        <p>To begin I will explain how this phase works!</p>
        <p>I will give you a mixture of questions and strategies.</p>
        <p>I will request that you answer the questions to your best knowledge!</p>

        <h2>I will start by explaining what an interpersonal conflict is.</h2>
        <p>In the case of Discord Moderation, an interpersonal conflict is a conflict between different persons.</p>
        <p>This conflict generally appears as a dispute between people.</p>
        <p>Many times this can result in something known as the "Halo/Horns" effect.</p>
        <p>This effect is identifying people as simply good or bad without taking into account that people are much more complex than that.</p>
        <p>This cognitive bias further worsens the relationship by increasing the amount and severity of conflicts that arise.</p>

        <h3>What can be an example of a conflict between two people?</h3>

        <p>To minimize and prevent conflicts in your server you must first figure out what is causing them to occur.</p>
        <p>Maybe there is an interpersonal conflict between two mods because they have different moderation methods.</p>
        <p>If that is the case, help them understand each other's logic and reasoning behind their different methodologies.</p>

        <h3>What might be the reason why one mod may warn for a meme while another one may do nothing?</h3>

        <p>Another big part of preventing conflict is learning everyone's opinion on it.</p>
        <p>Introduce Democratic ideas like members and staff voting their opinions on aspects of the server.</p>
        <p>This helps you learn their opinion on the matter.</p>
        <p>You should also create personal relationships with as many people as you can in the server to understand their points of view before making decisions about anything.</p>

        <h3>Now, I will ask you to make an announcement telling members to vote their opinion via two reactions, one is yes :thumbsup: and the other is no :thumbsdown:.</h3>
        <h3>It is important to be non-supportive of gossip(globally, saying things about people that arenâ€™t true) and try to stop people from spreading it as much as you can. You should also make sure that you don't critique people unless you are actively providing alternative ideas to help them improve and critique in the nicest way possible.</h3>

        <h3>Give me one criticism about my performance in this training and suggest what I should be doing instead. Remember to be polite and helpful!</h3>

        <p>There are many causes for interpersonal conflicts to arise.</p>
        <p>As I mentioned earlier a difference in moderation methodology or even other ideologies or belief systems.</p>
        <p>That includes religion and political beliefs too.</p>

        <h3>What is one political or religious belief that may conflict with another political or religious belief and why?</h3>

        <p>Competition is another common cause of interpersonal conflict.</p>
        <p>Many people feel the need to compete especially in a staff team so that they can reach their goals fast and efficiently.</p>
        <p>The biggest issue with this is competing with someone can make the other person look bad whether you are intentionally doing it or not.</p>
        <p>So instead try to guide people to focus on themselves instead of how they measure up to others.</p>
        <p>In events competing is perfectly acceptable as it is the purpose however.</p>

        <h3>What should you do if there is only one staff position left and you see two members both expressing to you why they should be mod and how they are better than the other person?</h3>

        <p>Always keep an eye out for harassment and bullying as this is a very common and one of the worst causes of conflict.</p>
        <p>What should you do if someone who is a higher rank than you is bullying a mod?</p>
        <h3>When typing make sure that what you say can't be misinterpreted since that can lead to unwanted conflict.</h3>

        <h3>To give an example, what is a comment that may be misinterpreted?</h3>

        <p>To conclude, sometimes there are conflicts where it comes from real life. Be aware of this and be careful handling this.</p>
