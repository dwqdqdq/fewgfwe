        <h1>Part 1: Different Useful Bots</h1>

        <p>To begin, I will explain how this part works! I will go through 5 bots, explaining how each works!</p>

        <p>For each bot, I will ask you to give me 2 unique commands and describe their utilities.</p>

        <h2>1. @Dyno</h2>
        <p>@Dyno is a utility bot which offers a wide range of general purpose moderation commands and features, alongside the joinrole feature and leaderboards, this bot works well and is extremely popular!</p>
        <p>Dyno's prefix: ?</p>
        <p>Commands can be found on Dyno's website or using their bot dashboard which allows you to control Dyno from its website! (<a href="https://dyno.gg">Dyno's Website</a>)</p>
        <h2>2. @Dank Memer</h2>
        <p>This is a much more entertainment-orientated bot. Dank Memer can produce commands via command and also has an economy system which is used across many servers and saves on every server that you are in. This means if you gain 20 currency in this server, you will also have that in every other server that has Dank Memer.</p>
        <p>Dank Memer's prefix: pls</p>
        <p>You can find the commands on Dank Memer's website! (<a href="https://dankmemer.lol">Dank Memer's Website</a>)</p>

        <h2>3. @Wick</h2>
        <p>Wick is commonly known for its anti-raid system, used to protect servers from raiders. This bot is loved by the community because it also has moderation functions, a dashboard, and it is very easy to use. A must-have for any server that plans to grow!</p>
        <p>Wickâ€™s prefix: w!</p>
        <p>You can find the commands on Wick's website! (<a href="https://wickbot.com/">Wick's Website</a>)</p>

        <h2>4. @Carl</h2>
        <p>Carl is a very common moderation bot that is used as a starter moderation bot as well as a normal one. Many beginners love it since it is very easy to use compared to other bots. A must-have for starters instead of mee6 or dyno.</p>
        <p>Carl's prefix: !</p>
        <p>You can find the commands on Carl's website! (<a href="https://carl.gg">Carl's Website</a>)</p>

        <h2>5. @Arcane</h2>
        <p>Arcane is a Multi-Purpose Discord bot, with an amazing leveling system, that includes even activity in voice channels! It offers very good reaction roles, YouTube notifications, custom commands, and more!</p>
        <p>Arcane's prefix: /</p>
        <p>All of the bot's commands can be found on Arcane's website! (<a href="https://arcane.bot/">Arcane's Website</a>)</p>
   
        <h1>Part 2: Ticket System</h1>

        <p>We will be using the commands of the Ticket tool bot, because the commands are almost always the same in all ticket bots.</p>

        <p>As with all bots, don't forget to check the bot's prefix.</p>

        <p>To make a new ticket, type $new. Some servers may use $ticket.</p>

        <p>To add a user to a ticket, type $add @user #channel. Example: $add @user #ticket-1048</p>

        <p>To remove a user from a ticket, type $remove @user #channel. Example: $remove @user #ticket-1048</p>

        <p>To close a ticket, type $close in the ticket channel.</p>

        <p>To save the transcript of a ticket (a log of all messages sent inside a ticket) type $transcript #channel</p>

        <p>To delete an already closed ticket, type $delete in the ticket channel.</p>

        <h2>IMPORTANT TIPS:</h2>

        <p>Tagging: You should never tag staff directly in a ticket channel, you should always tag staff in a staff channel.</p>
        <p>Here's how you should do it: @user #channel (do you need help or do they need to take over the ticket): (situation)</p>
        <p>Example: @user #ticket-2049 please take over: partner request</p>

        <p>Who has the response responsibility inside a ticket?</p>
        <p>If the staff doesn't respond to a ticket in a chosen (by the higher-ups) amount of time, you should tag them in a staff channel to let them know.</p>

        <p>Never argue with a fellow staff member inside a ticket; always discuss/argue in a staff channel or in DMs.</p>
        <p>You can always give tips or tell them your opinion about the situation, but you should avoid doing it inside the ticket.</p>

        <p>How do you respond to a ticket?</p>

        <p>How do you end the discussion in a ticket?</p>

        <p>{The trainer has to answer a ticket made by the trainer}</p>
        <p>{Have them use the different commands in that ticket}</p>
