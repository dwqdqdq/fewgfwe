        <h1>[PHASE 3] CAPACITY OVERLOOK</h1>
        <p>To begin, I will explain how this phase works! I explain 6 situations, one at a time, and you tell me how you would handle them! In this phase, you are considered a staff member.</p>

        <h2>[Situation 1]</h2>
        <p>You receive a DM from a member. The DM contains a server link to that person’s server. You never asked for the link and you have never talked to them before. What should you do?</p>

        <h2>[Situation 2]</h2>
        <p>You enter a chat that isn't used as much and see a server member offering nitro for a role in the server that allows them to appear much higher on the member list. The staff member hasn’t accepted it yet but is considering it. What should you do in this case?</p>

        <h2>[Situation 3]</h2>
        <p>A group of members are being verbally aggressive to a member of staff. They are throwing insults, threats, and just being extremely disrespectful towards your fellow staff member! What would you do?</p>

        <h2>[Situation 4]</h2>
        <p>A new member joins the server. You see a group of people who have been in the server for about a year now make fun of the user’s profile picture claiming that “Anime pfps are gay”. What should you do in this case?</p>

        <h2>[Situation 5]</h2>
        <p>A member of the server enters general chat and posts a pic of a fully clothed woman. The server has channels reserved for NSFW but general chat isn’t one of them. The member thinks the woman is very attractive and so he says “This girl is hot af look at her!”. Nobody has said anything to the member yet. What would you do in a situation such as this?</p>

        <h2>[Situation 6]</h2>
        <p>Sam created a ticket reporting a user insulting him in DM. After an hour, Sam decides to create more and more tickets and send over and over the proof in every ticket. What should you do?</p>
