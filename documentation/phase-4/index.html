        <h1>[PHASE 4] REPORTS AND SPAM PHASE</h1>
        <p>To begin, I will explain how this phase works! I will write 3 tickets as if they were issued by members of the server, reporting incidents both involving staff and members, and you will react to each ticket in the correct way! Then I will show you 3 examples of much more difficult situations, where the incident is oriented around something more difficult to judge! E.g. someone joking about something and someone taking it seriously where it's hard to determine if they were serious or not! In this phase, you are considered a staff member.</p>

        <h2>[First ticket]</h2>
        <p><strong>Title:</strong> A member of staff called me a ni&&er and said I should rot</p>
        <p><strong>Context:</strong> A member of staff in general said that I have a black pfp so I'm a ni&&er and said I shouldn't be in this server or even this world!! I have cried about this a lot now. Please help MEEEEE</p>

        <h2>[Second ticket]</h2>
        <p><strong>Title:</strong> DM advertisement</p>
        <p><strong>Context:</strong> Hi, I just got a DM advertisement from a user on this server, I would like to report this.</p>

        <h2>[Third ticket]</h2>
        <p><strong>Title:</strong> Hi, I need help.</p>
        <p><strong>Context:</strong> How do I access all the roles in this server, and also I watched someone post porn in bot commands, I kinda liked and enjoyed it!!! But, it's against server rules! Can you remove it.</p>

        <h2>[First situation]</h2>
        <p><strong>Info:</strong> 3 members are chatting in General. One of them (friend 1) posts a meme in memes showing black children going to school that is not racist. The next friend (friend 2) posts a meme saying "NO GOD NO" (making fun of the fact that they are black) and then friend 2 says "jk". Friend 3, is upset, he gets upset and angry at friend 2, telling friend 2 that it isn't a laughing matter. Friend 1 sits by and files a brief ticket to staff describing the situation! Friend 2 claims it was a complete joke to friend 3, You arrive at the scene! What do you do?</p>

        <h2>[Second situation]</h2>
        <p><strong>Info:</strong> The owner is online. Plum, the owner’s girlfriend is in general. Ret, a server booster, is in the bot channel, a SFW channel. Plum starts to spam links in the channel she’s in. At the same time, Ret is sending NSFW in the channel he’s in. The owner doesn’t seem to care at all, but is still looking at the server. What should you do?</p>

        <h2>[Third situation]</h2>
        <p><strong>Info:</strong> Neo was banned due to DM advertisement 1 year ago. Neo is trying to get unbanned from the server and so, is sending you a message. The message contains the following: “Hello, I would like to be unbanned, ‘cause I got banned like a year ago for some dumb DM advertisement and I would like to be allowed back, ‘cause I stopped doing that, please.” What should you do?</p>
